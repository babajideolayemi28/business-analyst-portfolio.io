### Sensor-Fault-Detection Project
[Github](https://github.com/Oladapoduk/sensor-fault-detection)
In this project, the system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. 
The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures for components not related to the APS system.
The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

### Sentiment analysis using Natural Language processing MLOPs/AIOPs-Project

This project aims to streamline the end-to-end process of training, tracking, and deploying NLP classification models, ensuring reproducibility and scalability while handling complex and evolving text data.

### Sales Forecasting using Machine learning
[Github](https://github.com/Oladapoduk/ROSS-MANSTORE-SALES)
This project will be based on Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM). A standard idea about data science project may be linear: data preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment. However, when we use CRISP-DM methodology a data science project become circle-like form. Even when it ends in Deployment, the project can restart again by Business Understanding.
